This is our First Semester project in CS Engineering

We used OpenGL for rendering
FreeGlut as window manager

It is purely written in C

We used CodeBlocks/Mingw32 for development

Can be used as an educational tool for those starting on OpenGL development/ Game development.

Controls:
[Esc,p(pause),arrow keys,enter]
mouse drag can rotate the environment
scroll for zoom in and out..

compiling.

This is based on Freeglut not original Glut and will not work with glut.
also link to Soil library.

this was originally compiled on mingw32/Gcc but will work on any compiler..
you might prefer codeblocks with mingw32 if you are unsure..


This is our first semester project on CS and is completely based on C i.e. no C++ code whasoever.


Hope you benefit..
Happy coding, Enjoy!
